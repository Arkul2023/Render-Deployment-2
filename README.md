### Topic - Telecom Customer Churn prediction

## Key Findings:

Churn Rate (26.5%): A significant portion of customers leave, with Month-to-Month contracts being the riskiest.

Contract Type: Month-to-Month contracts have the highest churn (~43%), compared to ~11% for 2-year contracts.

Tenure: Most churn occurs within the first 12 months, suggesting weak early retention.

Charges: Churned customers pay higher average monthly charges, indicating price sensitivity.

Service Type: Multi-service customers churn less, showing service bundling improves loyalty.

### Business Recommendations:

Provide discounts or perks for customers who switch to long-term contracts.

Focus retention campaigns on customers within their first year.

Consider tiered pricing or loyalty discounts for high-charge customers.

Encourage service bundling to improve stickiness.
